# WinampRPC
This script simply makes a rich presence into Discord and shows the track and artist you are playing. Winamp.py is a slightly modified version [this](https://github.com/DerpyChap/PyWinamp) winamp controller. Unfortunately I dont know how to make Winamp plugins so the rp.py console needs to be always running. So far I have not encountered any problems while using this script.
# Requirements
- Winamp
- Python 3.6+
- `pypresence` 3.3.0+ (May work with earlier versions too)

# How to use
1. Ensure you meet the requirements
2. Download the files and place them in the same directory
3. Run rp.py while using winamp
